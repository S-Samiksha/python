# python
Hello, this are the codes I did while studying year 1 cs. 

Analog Clock: Following a Youtube video, i tried to create a analog clock using the turtle module 

BullsAndCowsSimple: 
I was assigned to make this game on python in the CZ1003 Module Introduction to Computational Thinking. This game runs on the python console


BullsAndCowsTurtle: 
I tried to incorporate the game into the turtle module so the game could run on a separate window and look nicer

Tic Tac Toe: This code was created by myself.
