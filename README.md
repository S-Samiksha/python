# python
Hello!

BullsAndCowsSimple: 
I was assigned to make this game on python in the CZ1103 Module Introduction to Computational Thinking. This game runs on the python console


BullsAndCowsTurtle: 
I tried to incorporate the game into the turtle module so the game could run on a separate window and look nicer
