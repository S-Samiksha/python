# python
Hello! 
There are a few files here! Let me give a description!
BullsAndCowsSimple: I was assigned to make this game on python. This game runs on the python console
BullsAndCowsTurtle: I tried to incorporate the game into the turtle module so the game could run on a separate window and look nicer
