# Python
These are the codes I did while studying year 1 Computer Science.

**Analog Clock:** 
Following a Youtube video, I tried to create a analog clock using the turtle module. 

**BullsAndCowsConsole:**
I was assigned to make this game on python in the CZ1003 Module Introduction to Computational Thinking. This game runs on the python console.


**BullsAndCowsTurtle:** 
I tried to incorporate the game into the turtle module so the game could run on a separate window and look nicer. 

**Tic Tac Toe:** 
I created a python code to play Tic Tac Toe on the turtle module.
